I'm looking to code some tools to use alongside some board games. 

This is a hobbiest project with the sole intention of improving my skills for application in a professional environment. 

I'm intending for this to be open source, although I am not looking for any suggestions to amend my work yet. 

In time I may look to invite suggestions for improvements, but I suspect that may be a future endeavour.
